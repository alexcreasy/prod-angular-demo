# Prod Angular Demo
This application is a simple quickstart used to accompany my intro to angular js 1.x talk for Red Hat productization.

### Setting Up The Development Environment

Pre-reqs:

* Node.js - [Download Here](http://nodejs.org/)
* Bower( version >= 0.9.1 ) - [Download Here](http://bower.io/)

Once the pre-reqs have been taken care of, run:

    npm install -g grunt-cli bower
    
    npm install

    bower install

To run:

    grunt server
    
Now everytime you save a file, grunt is watching and will copy to configured directories.
