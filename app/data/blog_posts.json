    "title": "Carbon nanotube memory tech gets great big cash dollop",
    "body": "Future memory hardware startup Nantero has had a big funding round, suggesting its technology is getting closer to becoming a reality.It got $31.5m in an over-subscribed round to continue developing its nanotube-based non-volatile RAM (NRAM) semiconductor technology, which it says has DRAM read/write speed and is ultra-high density â€“ think terabits. Nantero said it will retain data for >1,000 years at 85 degrees Celsius or more than 10 years at 300 degrees Celsius. The power consumption is said to be essentially zero in standby mode, and it needs 1/160th of the write energy per bit that NAND does. Oh, and it can scale below 5nm geometry, be 3D multi-layer and have two bits per cell (MLC), and uses standard CMOS production processes......"
